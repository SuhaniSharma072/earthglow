      <p>Chapped lips happen when the skin on the lips becomes dry, cracked, or irritated. They are often caused by cold weather, wind, sun exposure, dehydration, or frequent licking of the lips.</p>

      <h2>Tan/Hyperpigmentation</h2>
      <p>Sun damage occurs when the skin is exposed to too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation, leading to premature aging, sunburn, and an increased risk of skin cancer. Tanning is the skinâ€™s response to this, producing more pigment (melanin) to protect deeper layers, but it also indicates damage has occurred. It often leads to hyperpigmentation.</p>

      <h2>Pimples</h2>
      <p>Pimples are small, inflamed spots on the skin that occur when hair follicles become clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. They often appear on the face, back, or chest and can be red, swollen, and sometimes filled with pus.</p>
