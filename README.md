# earthglow
EarthGlow is a website that helps users learn about natural skincare ingredients, DIY recipes, and sun care tips. I made this project to share safe, inexpensive, and time-tested skincare solutions that are easy to understand and use and that I have personally used and experienced benefits from. I built this website using HTML and CSS. While creating it, I struggled with coding the quiz in order to make sure it takes the answers from the users and gives an accurate score based on how many questions were correct.
