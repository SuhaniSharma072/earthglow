    <p1> Now that you’ve put in the work to care for and improve your skin, the most important step is protecting it. Without protection, all that progress can be undone by sun damage. Up to 80% of premature skin aging is caused by UV rays, and even on cloudy days, harmful rays can reach and harm your skin. Unprotected sun exposure doesn’t just cause burns — it leads to hyperpigmentation, tanning, and dark spots that can make skin tone uneven over time. Daily sunscreen is one of the best defenses against these changes, while also helping to prevent wrinkles, dryness, and even skin cancer. Pairing sunscreen with simple habits like wearing a hat, seeking shade, and avoiding peak sun hours ensures your skin stays bright, even-toned, and healthy. Protecting your skin today means preserving your results and glow for years to come.</p1>

    <p1>Sunscreen is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 can significantly reduce the risk of skin cancer, sunburn, and premature aging. The Skin Cancer Foundation notes that up to 80% of premature skin aging is caused by UV exposure, which can also lead to hyperpigmentation, tanning, and dark spots over time. Even on cloudy days, harmful UV rays can penetrate through clouds and windows, making sunscreen necessary year-round. Experts recommend reapplying every two hours, or more often if swimming or sweating. According to the Cleveland Clinic, mineral sunscreens (with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) are ideal for sensitive skin because they act as a physical barrier, while chemical sunscreens absorb UV rays and are often lighter and invisible on the skin. Both are effective when applied correctly, but consistency is key. Protecting your skin with sunscreen not only preserves your natural glow but also safeguards your long-term skin health.Below are some dermatologist-recommended suncreens:</p1>
